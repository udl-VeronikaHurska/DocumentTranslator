#### Usage

After starting the Translation API, it will be available at http://localhost:8000. You can interact with the API via HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s an example of how to translate a document:

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/translate_document?src_lang=ukrainian&tgt_lang=english&output_format=docx" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-F "file=@/path/to/your/document.docx"
```
** <i>Replace <b>/path/to/your/document.docx</b> with the path to the document you want to translate.</i>
